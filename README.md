HANGMAN:

A classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word, one letter at a time.
For each wrong guess, a part of a stick figure (the "hangman") is drawn, and the player loses a life.
The goal is to guess all the letters correctly before running out of lives.

In this Python version:

The computer randomly selects a word from a small list.

The player has 6 chances (lives) to guess letters.

The game ends when the player either guesses the full word or uses all lives.

PYHTON KEY CONCEPTS USED : 

random.choice() → to randomly pick a word from the list.

while loop → to keep the game running until win/loss condition.

if-else → for checking correct/incorrect guesses.

Lists & Strings → to manage guessed letters and show progress.
